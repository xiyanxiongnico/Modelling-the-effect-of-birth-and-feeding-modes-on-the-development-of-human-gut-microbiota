# Modelling-the-effect-of-birth-and-feeding-modes-on-the-development-of-human-gut-microbiota
This repository contains source files for the project: Modelling the effect of birth and feeding modes on the development of human gut microbiota.
The source code for this project are in the 'code' folder, which include the code for the mathematical models, data generation and to plot the generated data. 
The 'competition model.R' and 'extended model.R' in the 'model' folder are the two versions of the mathematical models we created. 
Scripts in the 'data generation' folder use the mathematical model to generate data ready for plotting. 
The 'plot generation' folder contains scripts used to generate the plots for this project. 
The 'plot' folder stores the generated plots.
