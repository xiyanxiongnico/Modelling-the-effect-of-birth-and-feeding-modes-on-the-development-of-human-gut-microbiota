# Modelling-the-effect-of-birth-and-feeding-modes-on-the-development-of-human-gut-microbiota
This repository contains source files for the project: Modelling the effect of birth and feeding modes on the development of human gut microbiota.
The 'competition model.R' and 'extended model.R' are the two versions of the mathematical models we created. 
The R files with names start with 'data_' call the above model files to generate data. 
The 'plots.R' file plot the generated data.
The 'nullclines plot.nb' is a mathematica file that generates the nullcline plots for the competitin model.
The 'compare quasi vs full model against alpha and h' and 'compare quasi vs full model dynamics' files generate plots to estimate the accuracy of the quasi-steady-state approximation.
